# Python Testing with pytest

## Overview

**Python Testing with pytest** by Brian Okken is a foundational guide to the pytest testing framework, enabling developers to write expressive and maintainable tests with minimal boilerplate code. Although originally published in **2017**, the book remains a valuable resource for understanding pytest's core principles and features.

## Key Features

- **Expressive Testing:** Write concise tests using Python's built-in `assert` statement, eliminating the need for verbose test code.
- **Robust Fixture Model:** Manage test setup and teardown cleanly with pytest's flexible fixture system.
- **Parameterization:** Easily test multiple input scenarios, reducing repetition and increasing coverage.
- **Extensibility:** Tap into a rich ecosystem of plugins and integrate with tools like `tox`, `mock`, and `coverage`.
- **Cross-Framework Compatibility:** Run tests from other frameworks such as `unittest` or `nose` within pytest.

## Learning Approach

The book takes a hands-on, practical approach by guiding the reader through building and testing a sample application. This structure helps reinforce the core concepts in a real-world development context.

## Author

**Brian Okken** is a software engineer and advocate for better testing practices in Python. In addition to this book, he hosts the **Test & Code** podcast and blog, which offers ongoing insights into software testing, Python development, and engineering culture.

## Note

While some examples and tool versions may be dated due to the 2017 publication, the testing concepts and pytest fundamentals presented are still widely applicable today.
